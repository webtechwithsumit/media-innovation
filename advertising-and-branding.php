                    A general perception is that both are same. This is a common misunderstanding. Advertising and Branding are both part of marketing with the main purpose of increasing revenue but both have different ways. Understanding the difference can strength the marketing strategy and your brand.
                        <br>
                        Branding is recoganisation of identity name, logo, business you do and what it make people thinks about it. This is how you start relating to your potential customer.
                        <br>
                        The major factors of brand recognition are logo and name of your company. They are the first thing people notice and build a basic perception on the basis of visual representation.
                        <br>
                        The Brand building process focuses more on what people will perceive and feel about you when they see or hear about your name.

                        Advertising on the other hand is communicating what you have to offer. Advertising creates familiarity.
                        <br>
                        The communication you share through TV, Radio, Print or any other media vehicle is like meeting between a potential customer and your company.
                        <br>
                        The difference between a customer who is familiar with your brand & communication through advertising and the one who is not is the same as asking your friend for help and asking the same from an unknown person.
